## 🌟 Project Description

The Aesthetic Digital Journal is a front-end web application created as the inaugural project for the **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge. The goal was to build a functional and visually appealing tool in a single day, focusing on a clean user experience and modern development practices. It serves as a personal space to write down daily thoughts, track moods, and tag entries for easy organization, with all data saved directly in your browser.

## ✨ Core Features

-   **📝 Create & Manage Entries:** Easily add, view, and delete journal entries.
-   **🎨 Multiple Aesthetic Themes:** Instantly switch between **Light**, **Dark**, and **Serene** color themes to match your vibe.
-   **😊 Mood & Tag Tracking:** Assign a mood (via emoji) and comma-separated tags to each entry.
-   **💾 Persistent Local Storage:** Your entries are automatically saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after you close the tab or refresh the page.
-   **📥 Download & Backup:** Export your entire journal as a formatted `.json` file for backup or use elsewhere.
-   **📱 Responsive Design:** A clean and functional layout that works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
-   **🧩 Component-Based Architecture:** Built with a clean, refactored structure where each part of the UI is its own reusable component.
